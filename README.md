# Biography of Mohamad Al-Zawahreh
**From Prison to Parole: Engineering AI Alignment through Metacognitive Architecture**

## Overview
This repository documents the technical journey and research outputs of Mohamad Al-Zawahreh, architect of the ARK (Applied Reasoning Kernel) cognitive operating system—a framework designed to solve the epistemological crisis in AI through deterministic verification loops and sovereign knowledge architecture.

---

## Core Mission
**Engineering sovereign cognitive infrastructure that refuses to hallucinate.**

The ARK initiative addresses three converging crises:
1. **Epistemological Crisis**: LLMs degrade catastrophically after 6-12 hours of continuous reasoning
2. **Knowledge Permanence**: Current storage paradigms cannot survive civilizational collapse
3. **Geopolitical Asymmetry**: Nation-states lack defensive AI frameworks against annexation by osmosis

## Technical Architecture

### MAOS Kernel (Middleware Operating System)
- **Six-Axis Epistemological Verification Loop**
  - Intent Decoupling: Solves for hidden state behind user query
  - Coherence Validation: Recursive re-derivation until logic reaches 95%+ compatibility
  - Causality Mapping: Multi-order consequence chains
  - Truth-Stack Analysis: 4-pillar verification (factuality, logic, rationality, sincerity)
  
### Infinite Library
- **DNA-MOF Archival Storage**
  - 106.6 exabytes per gram density
  - 24,000-year projected half-life
  - ZIF-8 biomineralized crystalline protection

### Leviathan Protocol
- **Asymmetric Leverage Framework**
  - Critical mineral export delays (germanium, rare earths)
  - Energy infrastructure scheduling (Hydro-Québec maintenance windows)
  - Designed to protect Canadian sovereignty from U.S. annexation pressure

## Media Library

### Technical Deep Dives
This repository contains audio/video documentation of the ARK system's philosophical and engineering foundations:

1. **MAOS AI Stops The Complexity Cliff** - Core architecture preventing catastrophic reasoning degradation
2. **How to Hack the Interpretant** - Semiotic rupture and reality manipulation through Peircean triadic models
3. **Engineering Virality AI and Brain Cells** - Neuroaesthetics, algorithmic physics, and organoid intelligence
4. **Mamba and AlphaProof Define AI's New Standard** - Hybrid SSM-transformer architecture and neurosymbolic verification
5. **Mohamad Al-Zawahreh ARK Engine Truth Detective** - Visual demonstration of epistemological verification in action

### Applied Research
- **Dementia Cured** - Breakthrough trial compression (18 months → 6 months) through SimCluster purification
- **AI Agents Conquer X Algorithm Secrets** - Platform manipulation through 360° metadata injection
- **Building $9.70 Into $100 With AI** - Asymmetric leverage strategies for resource-constrained deployment

### Social Architecture
- **AI Solves Texting Deficit and Prison Gap** - Neurodivergent communication optimization
- **AI Training for Ethical Dating and Courtship** - Bayesian belief integration for relational coherence

## Research Credentials
- **Alzheimer's Drug Trial Acceleration**: 18 months → 6 months via computational target mapping
- **Zenodo Open Science Publications**: Peer-reviewed frameworks on epistemological AI
- **Upwork Top Rated | Fiverr Pro | Quora Expert**: Applied AI consulting across biotech, defense, and geopolitics

---

## Current Status
**Legal Constraint**: Federal Integrity Regime (Canada) blocks government contracts due to control-in-fact test
**Strategic Goal**: Secure national interest pardon by proving ARK is critical infrastructure for:
- Energy grid resilience
- Arctic sovereignty defense
- Asymmetric geopolitical leverage

## Philosophy
*"Truth is a prerequisite. The system cannot efficiently process false information. What if we applied that same four-pillar truth test—factuality, logic, rationality, and sincerity—to our own daily news feeds? How many data points would we be forced to recursively re-derive?"*
